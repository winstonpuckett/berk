# Summary

Berk "The Donut Man" Jones. Age 35, Height 6'2", Weight 250lbs. Social 2w1

# Occupation

Berk runs a donut business on 1st and lantern. The type of place you go when you're a local, but wouldn't think of as a tourist. His shop is old and run-down, just like the street it's on. He has two employees, Jo and Josie, who rotate duty for making donuts. Berk makes a few special batches each month for special customers, but to the outside world, it looks like he mostly handles PR, accounting, and special projects for the shop.

# Personality

Berk is a quiet, steady force. Like carmel running down vanilla ice cream. You always know when Berk is in the room even if he doesn't say anything. The air is more calm, your thoughts are less tangled.

Everyone knows Berk around town. He's done a lot of community service projects cleaning things up after the super heros changed their motto from "do no evil." He's one of those people you hope your kids turn out like, but know he's not cool enough to be a true role model for them.

He's happy and satisfied with life whenever he can be helping someone. These days, that happens a lot.

# Triggers

Berk hates it when the big guy picks on the little guy and will always get in fights when this happens. He's made a lot of friends this way, but has also made a lot of enemies. There are certain parts of town he avoids because he knows he'll probably end up dead if he interferes.
