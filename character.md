# Summary

Berk "The Donut Man" Jones. Age 35, Height 6'2", Weight 250lbs.

# Occupation

Berk runs a donut business. The type of place you go when you're a local, but wouldn't think of as a tourist. His shop is old and run-down, just like the street it's on. He has two employees, Jo and Josie, who rotate duty for making donuts. Berk makes a few special batches each month for special customers, but to the outside world, it looks like he mostly handles PR, accounting, and special projects for the shop.

# Personality

Berk is a quiet, steady force. Like carmel running down the side of vanilla ice cream.
