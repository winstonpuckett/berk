# Summary

Berk "The Donut Man" Jones. Age 35, Height 6'2", Weight 250lbs. Social 2w1

# Occupation

Berk runs a donut business on 1st and lantern. The type of place you go when you're a local, but wouldn't think of as a tourist. His shop is old and run-down, just like the street it's on. He has two employees, Jo and Josie, who rotate duty for making donuts. Berk makes a few special batches each month for special customers, but to the outside world, it looks like he mostly handles PR, accounting, and special projects for the shop.

He lives above the shop in a studio apartment.

# Personality

Berk is a quiet, steady force. Like carmel running down vanilla ice cream. You always know when Berk is in the room even if he doesn't say anything. The air is more calm, your thoughts are less tangled.

Everyone knows Berk around town. He's done a lot of community service projects cleaning things up after the super heros changed their motto from "do no evil." He's one of those people you hope your kids turn out like, but know he's not cool enough to be a true role model for them.

He's happy and satisfied with life whenever he can be helping someone. These days, that happens a lot.

# Triggers

Berk hates it when the big guy picks on the little guy and will always get in fights when this happens. He's made a lot of friends this way, but has also made a lot of enemies. There are certain parts of town he avoids because he knows he'll probably end up dead if he interferes.

- Will always intervene when someone bullies a defenseless person
- Does not allow any alcoholic beverage, or any kind of substance around him
- Addicted to sugar, will eat too much wherever he's at

# Fears

- Not being able to help
- No one wanting his help
- Addicts & the drugs/alcohol they use

# Hopes

- Justice
- People acting righteously
- Being able to help

# Childhood

Berk was supposed to be named Brick, but his father was drunk when he signed Berk's birth certificate.

# Powers

Berk can bi-directionally, telepathically communicate with anyone currently eating one of the donuts he creates. 

## Rules

- Berk **will** hear the thoughts of anyone eating one of his donuts.
- Most targets will not be aware of Berk's presence in their brains
- Berk can only hear thoughts in real-time
- Berk cannot imbue messages onto donuts

## Success / Failure 

- Success looks like the right person, at the right time, thinking the right stuff eating the donut.
- Failure looks like one or more of these things not working out. Perhaps the wrong person picks up the donut, maybe the person isn't thinking about what you're hoping for, maybe all Berk can hear is chewing.

# Projects

## "Reunite"

Lots of families were displaced in the war. Berk keeps his ear to the ground for families that have been split up and who might have seen those family members recently.

## "Shelter"

Berk spends his Friday afternoons working with a group to build small shelters for displaced persons. These shelters are donated to people for free with the request the person helps build a shelter for someone else.

## Prayer

There's an old abandoned church on 12th and Merica. Every Sunday at 4 am he walks there with as much bread as he has in his house. There's an old out-of-tune piano at the church. He plays the piano as if it's the last one in the world and laments how things are.

After a couple hours, he walks home a different way, laying the bread next to anyone still lying on the street

# Habits

## Food

Whenever he's feeling too upset, he'll overeat. Even stealing things from strangers' plates if he can get away with it.

## Secrecy

While he does a lot of really great things, he's more secretive than anyone could imagine. He has an iron vault of information and when something goes in, it never comes out unless it's absolutely necessary.

## Judgemental

If you don't do things a certain way, Berk will judge you both behind your back **and** to your face. There's a right way and a wrong way to do things and you better not do things the wrong way around Berk.

# Secrets

## Berk's family

Has a family out East. Once every 6 months, a courier comes to take a special batch of donuts back to them. He never knows when they'll take a bite of his donut and he's able to talk to them again. He lives each day hoping, longing, and praying for that moment. Several times throughout the years the donuts got lost or moldy, and it was a whole year before he spoke to his family.

They're out East because it's safer there. It's not as close to the epicenter of where the superheroes became evil, and so there's not as much violence. They get to live rich, full lives out there and occassionally.

## Berk's smuggling operation

Berk's donuts has always had the best donuts in the capital. The reason is that he has a special shipment of rare spices sent to him once a month. This is all under the covers and if the government were to find out, he'd be in deep trouble for tax evasion.

## Berk's diamonologue

Something strange happens when Berk eats one of his own donuts. He's able to communicate telepathically with himself and hold full conversations. Within this bizarre loop, he's able to have a complete out-of-body experience, much like what it feels like to take certain drugs.

Berk does this often to disassociate and calm himself down, but is deeply ashamed of what it would look like if anyone found out, and so hasn't told anyone.
